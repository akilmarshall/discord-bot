A discord bot for fun.

## Capabilities

### Dice Roll
If your message consists of dn, mdn, or mdn+k  where the n,m,k are integers you will roll a dn m times and add a modifier k.

## TODO

- rename the bot
- create a second bot token as a test instance
- initiative system
- DnD api
- copy pasta
- macros?

each member enters name and initiative number (they can self calculate)
enemy name + initiative
sort high to low
this dictates turn order (print it)
the bot then steps through the turn order player and enemies until combat ends

## Dependencies

- python 3
- discord.py
